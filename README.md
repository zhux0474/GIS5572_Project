Project Description:
  There is a major demand for an online easy-to-access updated system for risk management and planning against the invasive Stink Bug Data spread in Minnesota. Although there are some publicly available data through MN Geospatial Commons, they are not customizable, complete, accurate, and cost-effective to update. Thus, a flexible system is required to map and model bug spread and rank the cities with the highest probability of bug movement. Using advanced technologies like google cloud and GIS databases, the system should be automatic in quality check and model evaluation and flexible with visualization in online mapping platforms like ArcGIS online. This project is an effort to build a real-time online system for a visualization map to allow users to monitor and detect â€œBrown Marmorated Stink Bug Invasive species'' spread across Minnesota. This helps prioritize a spread ranked list of cities and automates quality assurance and quality control procedures.
